![Brain Tumor Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Brain%20Tumor%20Detection-v1.0-blue)

Welcome to the **Brain Tumor Detection** project! This repository focuses on classifying brain MRI images into two categories: **Tumor** and **No Tumor**. We utilize **Transfer Learning** with the **VGG16** model to create an accurate deep learning model. The primary goal is to assist in the early detection of brain tumors from medical images, ultimately aiming to improve patient outcomes.

## Introduction

Brain tumors pose significant health risks, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. This project employs deep learning techniques to analyze MRI images, helping healthcare professionals make informed decisions. The model can distinguish between images that show the presence of a tumor and those that do not, thus serving as a valuable tool in medical diagnostics.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you need to set up your environment. Follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Use the following command to clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iXuspopaVenorus/Brain-Tumor-Detection.git
   cd Brain-Tumor-Detection
   ```

2. **Install Required Libraries**  
   Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download Dataset**  
   You can find the dataset in the `data` directory. If it's not available, please check the [Releases](https://github.com/iXuspopaVenorus/Brain-Tumor-Detection/releases) section for the dataset.

## Usage

After setting up the project, you can start using it for your own analysis. Hereâ€™s how:

1. **Train the Model**  
   Run the training script:
   ```bash
   python src/train.py
   ```

2. **Evaluate the Model**  
   To evaluate the model on test data, use:
   ```bash
   python src/evaluate.py
   ```

3. **Use the Model for Prediction**  
   You can also create a script to make predictions on new images.

## Model Training

Training the model involves several steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   The images are resized and normalized. This helps the model learn better.

2. **Transfer Learning with VGG16**  
   We use the VGG16 model as a base. This model has already learned features from a large dataset. We fine-tune it on our MRI images.

3. **Training Configuration**  
   The model is trained using a specified number of epochs and batch size. Adjust these parameters based on your system capabilities.

4. **Saving the Model**  
   After training, the model is saved for future use. You can load this model for making predictions.

## Evaluation

Evaluation is a critical step to ensure the model's performance. The evaluation script computes metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. 

1. **Load the Model**  
   The trained model is loaded from the saved file.

2. **Test Dataset**  
   The model is evaluated on a separate test dataset to ensure it generalizes well.

3. **Metrics Calculation**  
   The evaluation script outputs key metrics that indicate how well the model performs.

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes several technologies:

- **Python**: The primary programming language.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building and training the deep learning model.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing tasks.
- **Scikit-learn**: For additional machine learning utilities.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For interactive analysis and visualization.
